% function yy = timeShaping(xx, ss)
% The target of this function is to return a vector of equal size as the
% input but with a white content except at the middle portion where the
% original signal content is used.
% This input vector in time domain is passed through a low pass filter 
% then measured the signal level.  This value is used to scale the 
% generated white noise vector. It is assumed that the signal content is 
% not at the low frequency spectrum.  The input and the generated noise
% are merged after applying windowing with a 50% overlap.
%
% Input:  xx -- a vector of samples in time domain, this is expected to be a
%              narrowband noise with a higher gain at around fs/4.
%         ss -- a scaler value acting as a gain applied to the estimated
%              background level.
% Output: yy -- a vector of samples in time domain, it is expected to be
%               widenband noise throughout except accept around the middle 
%               where it is replaced with xx.
